      "Xiu is a cat almost two years old. Although both parents are small, but perhaps because she is loved and cared for by her family, she is very chubby. Xiu's whole body is a beautiful yellow fur, sometimes with red-orange streaks like tiger stripes. Her four legs are white as if she were wearing socks. Xiu's head is shaped like a bicycle saddle, holding it in the palm of his father's hand. Her nose is black, always wet. Whenever that nose rubs on me, I know right away that she wants to eat. Xiu's ears are small, always on the alert. But it's only quick to find people peeling off snacks, but I've never seen her catch a mouse. Even so, the whole family still loves Xiu's afternoon very much. That is clearly shown through its full necklaces, pretty shirts and toy basket full of it. And of course, the most obvious proof, nothing is more certain than her round belly, four chubby legs and soft fur."
